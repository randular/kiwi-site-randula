        <span id="desc-first-part">The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small, brown, fuzzy, and
            found in the produce section
        </span>
        <span id="desc-second-part">
            of your local supermarket. But the kiwi is not a fruitâ€”that's kiwifruit, which is native to eastern
            Asia! About the size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird found only in
            New Zealand.
